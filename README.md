# mastering-Kubernetes
This repository contains the artifacts to learn Kubernetes.

That sounds like an excellent plan! You're aiming for both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice with Kubernetes, using a Spring Boot (SB) application backed by a PostgreSQL database in a local Kind cluster. I'll take you step by step through everything, linking theory to practice using this application as an example.

Here’s the outline of the plan, covering both Kubernetes fundamentals and in-depth concepts:

### **Step-by-Step Learning Plan for Kubernetes with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL**

---

### **Phase 1: Spring Boot Application Setup**

**Objective**: Create a simple Spring Boot application connected to a PostgreSQL database, containerize it, and push the image to DockerHub.

1. **Spring Boot Application Setup**  
   - Create a basic Spring Boot REST API that performs CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database.
   - Use `Spring Data JPA` to interact with the database.

2. **Dockerize the Spring Boot Application**  
   - Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the Spring Boot app.
   - Configure PostgreSQL in a separate container using Docker Compose (optional, to simulate the DB locally before Kubernetes).

3. **Push to DockerHub**  
   - Build and tag the Docker image.
   - Push the Docker image to your DockerHub account, ensuring the image is accessible for Kubernetes deployments.

**Hands-On**: 
- Implement the Spring Boot app.
- Create the `Dockerfile`, build the image, and push it to DockerHub.

### **Phase 2: Local Kubernetes Cluster Setup with Kind**

**Objective**: Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind and prepare it for deploying your Spring Boot application.

1. **Install and Set Up Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**  
   - Install Kind if not already set up.
   - Create a local Kind cluster.

2. **Verify the Cluster**  
   - Ensure `kubectl` is configured to interact with the Kind cluster.
   - Test the cluster with simple commands (`kubectl get nodes`, `kubectl get pods`, etc.).

**Hands-On**: 
- Set up the Kind cluster and perform basic operations to familiarize yourself with Kubernetes CLI.

---

### **Phase 3: Kubernetes Basics with the Spring Boot Application**

**Objective**: Deploy the Spring Boot and PostgreSQL containers to the Kubernetes cluster. Understand key Kubernetes objects: Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.

1. **Pods and Deployments**  
   - Create a basic `Deployment` for the Spring Boot application.
   - Create a `Deployment` for the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Services**  
   - Expose the Spring Boot app internally using a `ClusterIP` Service.
   - Expose PostgreSQL to the Spring Boot app via another `ClusterIP` Service.

3. **Environment Configuration**  
   - Use `ConfigMaps` to inject non-sensitive environment variables (like DB URL).
   - Use `Secrets` to manage sensitive configuration (like DB credentials).

**Hands-On**:  
- Write Kubernetes YAML manifests for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.
- Deploy the Spring Boot app and PostgreSQL into the Kind cluster.

---

### **Phase 4: Persistence and Storage**

**Objective**: Set up persistent storage for PostgreSQL using Kubernetes `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` resources.

1. **Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)**  
   - Create a `PersistentVolume` to store PostgreSQL data.
   - Create a `PersistentVolumeClaim` for the PostgreSQL Deployment to use the PersistentVolume.

2. **Volume Mounting**  
   - Mount the persistent storage into the PostgreSQL container.

**Hands-On**:  
- Write YAML for PVs and PVCs.
- Verify PostgreSQL data persistence even after pod deletion.

---

### **Phase 5: Kubernetes Networking**

**Objective**: Explore Kubernetes networking models and introduce external access to your Spring Boot application.

1. **Kubernetes Networking Basics**  
   - Understand how Pods communicate internally within a cluster using `Services`.
   - Understand the networking model, including IP addressing and DNS in Kubernetes.

2. **Expose the Spring Boot Application Externally**  
   - Use a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` (Kind supports NodePort) to expose the Spring Boot app to external traffic.

3. **Ingress Controllers**  
   - Set up an Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx) to manage external access.
   - Use `Ingress` resources to route traffic based on paths or hostnames.

**Hands-On**:  
- Create Ingress rules to access the Spring Boot app externally.
- Optionally explore `Service Meshes` (like Istio or Linkerd) for advanced networking.

---

### **Phase 6: Scaling and Load Balancing**

**Objective**: Learn how to scale your application and manage load balancing with Kubernetes.

1. **Scaling the Spring Boot Application**  
   - Scale the Spring Boot `Deployment` to multiple replicas.
   - Understand how Kubernetes distributes traffic across Pods.

2. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**  
   - Configure autoscaling based on CPU usage or other metrics.
   - Set up `Metrics Server` in the Kind cluster for autoscaling.

**Hands-On**:  
- Scale the application manually.
- Configure and test Horizontal Pod Autoscaling.

---

### **Phase 7: Kubernetes Security**

**Objective**: Explore Kubernetes security mechanisms for securing both the application and cluster.

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   - Configure roles and permissions using Kubernetes `RBAC` to secure access to the cluster.

2. **Network Policies**  
   - Implement `NetworkPolicies` to control communication between Pods.

3. **Pod Security**  
   - Implement security contexts, restricting root access and setting resource limits.

**Hands-On**:  
- Secure the PostgreSQL and Spring Boot deployments using RBAC and Network Policies.
- Use Secrets and encrypted volumes for sensitive data.

---

### **Phase 8: Monitoring and Logging**

**Objective**: Set up observability to monitor the performance and logs of your Spring Boot application in Kubernetes.

1. **Logs with `kubectl logs`**  
   - Use `kubectl logs` to view logs for both Spring Boot and PostgreSQL containers.

2. **Integrating Prometheus and Grafana**  
   - Install Prometheus for collecting metrics and Grafana for visualizing them.
   - Monitor your Spring Boot app's CPU, memory usage, and other metrics.

3. **Using Fluentd/ELK Stack for Logging**  
   - Set up centralized logging with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd for log aggregation.

**Hands-On**:  
- Implement Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the cluster and your application.
- Optionally, explore logging setups with Fluentd.

### **Phase 9: Advanced Topics**

**Objective**: Dive deeper into Kubernetes with advanced use cases and troubleshooting techniques.

1. **Helm for Kubernetes Package Management**  
   - Use Helm to package your Spring Boot app and PostgreSQL as charts.
   - Deploy the application with Helm and manage versioning.

2. **StatefulSets for Databases**  
   - Learn about `StatefulSets` and when to use them, particularly for databases.

3. **Kubernetes Operators**  
   - Explore Operators for automating deployment and lifecycle management.

4. **CI/CD Pipelines**  
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.) to automate deployments to Kubernetes.

**Hands-On**:  
- Use Helm for app management.
- Optionally, implement a CI/CD pipeline for your Kubernetes app.

### **Phase 10: Kubernetes in Production**

**Objective**: Prepare your Spring Boot application for running in production environments.

1. **Cluster Setup for Production**  
   - Learn about production-grade Kubernetes clusters (AKS, EKS, GKE).
   - Understand how to configure high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.

2. **Security Best Practices for Production**  
   - Apply Kubernetes security best practices for production environments.

3. **Performance Tuning**  
   - Fine-tune Kubernetes resource requests/limits, autoscaling, and load balancing.

**Hands-On**:  
- Set up resource requests and limits for your deployments.
- Explore different production-grade configurations.

### **Final Outcome**
By the end of this plan, you’ll:
- Have a deep understanding of all major Kubernetes components and how to interact with them.
- Know how to deploy, scale, monitor, and secure a real-world application in Kubernetes.
- Be comfortable working with both local clusters (Kind) and transitioning to production-grade environments.
